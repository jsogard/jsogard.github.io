            <h2>joe sogard</h2>
            <p>Joe is currently a student at Iowa State University anticipates <b>graduation in May 2018</b>. He is studying <b>Software Engineering</b> and has had <b>relevant internships</b> and other jobs since his Sophomore year. In school he participates in many clubs as the Treasurer of <b>Digital Women</b>, a head co-organizer of <b>HackISU</b> and Digital Women: Code Jam, and a participant of many other clubs at ISU.</p>
            <p>After graduation Joe is looking for a full-time Software Engineering job in the Midwest, the Pacific NorthWest, or even Canada. Professionally, he is interested in a job that challenges him and grows his technical skillset. Specifically, he wants to work in <b>full-stack</b> or <b>back-end web development</b> or <b>application development</b> but he's open to nearly anything else in the software development field</p>
            <p>Joe grew up in Edina, a suburb near Minneapolis, Minnesota. Growing up he joined the Boy Scouts of America, which established his love for camping and the outdoors. Ever since acheiving the rank of Eagle Scout he has gone on a week-long backpacking trip with his close friends on the north shore of Minnesota. In his free time he mainly enjoys hanging out with friends, running, knitting, and working on side programming projects.</p>
