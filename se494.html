            <h2>joe sogard</h2>
            <p>Joe is currently a student at Iowa State University anticipates <b>graduation in May 2018</b>. He is studying <b>Software Engineering</b> and has had <b>relevant internships</b> and other jobs since his Sophomore year. In school he participates in many clubs as the Treasurer of <b>Digital Women</b>, a head co-organizer of <b>HackISU</b> and Digital Women: Code Jam, and a participant of many other clubs at ISU.</p>
            <p>After graduation Joe is looking for a full-time Software Engineering job in the Midwest, the Pacific NorthWest, or even Canada. Professionally, he is interested in a job that challenges him and grows his technical skillset. Specifically, he wants to work in <b>full-stack</b> or <b>back-end web development</b> or <b>application development</b> but he's open to nearly anything else in the software development field</p>
            <p>Joe grew up in Edina, a suburb near Minneapolis, Minnesota. Growing up he joined the Boy Scouts of America, which established his love for camping and the outdoors. Ever since acheiving the rank of Eagle Scout he has gone on a week-long backpacking trip with his close friends on the north shore of Minnesota. In his free time he mainly enjoys hanging out with friends, running, knitting, and working on side programming projects.</p>

                    <h3>Whiteboard With Friends</h3>
                </a>
                <p>This project started off as me and my roommate's final for our first ever web development class. We were initially tasked with creating a web-app that utilized AngularJS with a PHP backend and a school-provided SQL database. With these stipulations we came up with a social networking web-app in which any user can log on with a unique username and draw on a universal canvas that is updated in real time! The project was a resounding success and we submitted it for an A, but we wanted to keep making it better. We eventually turned it into a site where anybody can create their own whiteboards with special permissions on them for their friends.</p>
                <p>This project is now dead because the servers with our data on them have since been wiped and given to another class, but I am now rebuilding it in a solo effort using

                    <h3>Personal/Professional Website</h3>
                </a>
                <p>Before my last job application season while in college I figured I needed a website that was more professional and representative of my abilities than the one I made while first learning what HTML was. I spent the end of my final summer developing this website so I could show it off to any potential employers. Coincidentally, I took a portfolio development class the very next semester which required me to do exactly that!</p>

                </a>
                <p>During my Senior year of college I started my first ever mobile development class. At the same time I had my first semester at school where I had absolutely no meal plan. After a few poorly planned grocery trips I was inspired to make an app to track how much I was spending on my food and how much I was spending on each meal. I know there are so many apps out there that have already made this, but I saw this as a simple enough first app to develop that could help me in my daily life, so I took the challenge and went with it!</p>

			<h2>NON-TECHNICAL COURSEWORK</h2>
			<p>My goals for the future of my career are not only technical, of course. I'm not just a code monkey, so being well rounded with all my non-technical skills is greatly important to me. It is very important to me that in the future I have a diverse environment that stimulates me not only technically but also within my other interests. That's why I have taken the General Education classes I have:</p>
			<div class="gen-ed">
                <h3>Intro to World Religions</h3>
                <p>STEM fields especially are not particularly diverse. This is unfortunate, but it encourages me as a member of that community to be welcoming and open to anybody that is not culturally similar to me, so they feel comfortable in this white male-dominated field. One way I have tried to expand my cultural awareness is by taking my school's <i>Intro to World Religions</i> class. This class has taught me many things about other diverse cultures that I will likely encounter in my future careers.</p>
            </div>
			<div class="gen-ed">
                <h3>The Holocaust</h3>
                <p>As odd as it sounds, my school's German History class - <i>The Holocaust</i> - is my favorite class I have taken. I have alwasy been interested in history and the amount of passion that the professor of this class had regarding the topic of the holocaust was infectious. I feel it is very important to have interests in subject matter that is not related to your career so that you are not constantly in work-mode and have a more well-rounded personality. This is why I felt it was important to take a class like this to satisfy my history interest.</p>
            </div>
			<div class="gen-ed">
                <h3>Beer, Wine, &amp; Spirits</h3>
                <p>Even though The Holocaust history class was my favorite course taken at ISU, obviously it was a huge downer and not fun to learn about. My most fun class that I have taken at my school has to be the hospitality class, <i>Intro to Beer, Wine, &amp; Spirits</i> for obvious reasons. Every week we would spend the first hour of class learning about the intricacies and differences between various beers, wines, and spirits, then during the last hour of the class we would pour our glasses and be able to taste and experience the differences ourselves! I feel this is actually an important class to take, because it really teaches you how to have fun in a professional setting.</p>
